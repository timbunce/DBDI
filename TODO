Establish a naming convention for files
    DBDI.pm6         = DriverManager class
    DBDI/$driver.pm6 = "A driver" (convention only to aid discovery, not required)
    DBDI/$driver/*   = Driver's private files

Any DBDI/*.pm6 file is assumed to be a driver.
Driver names should be lowercase.
All-caps names are reserved for future use.


Establish base classes/roles


Establish exception hierarchy
    (maybe hardwire till java2perl6api can do this for us)
    Start using the exception hierarchy

Consider ways to abstract tracing out of the drivers.
    Perhaps via a wrapper driver like http://www.p6spy.com/ ?
