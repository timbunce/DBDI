Establish a naming convention for files
    DBDI.pm6        = Driver manager class
    DBDI/$driver/*  = Driver files (convention only to aid discovery, not required)
    DBDIguts/*      = base classes/roles


Establish base classes/roles


Establish exception hierarchy
    (maybe hardwire till java2perl6api can do this for us)
    Start using the exception hierarchy

Consider ways to abstract tracing out of the drivers.
    Perhaps via a wrapper driver like http://www.p6spy.com/ ?
